<!-- Styled and Responsive Web Page Boilerplate
Have you ever needed to create a decent looking simple website for your personal project, but did you spend more time on its design than on working on its functionality? This is normally not a problem but I found it tedious. This extension will solve the issue for you with a simple !T + @<page name> and you're up and running with a fully styled and responsive web page template. Connect web pages together and voila you have a ready website.
